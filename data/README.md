# About this data

Wildfire data set is taken from National Interagency Fire Center. 
https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::wfigs-wildland-fire-locations-full-history/explore?filters=eyJEYWlseUFjcmVzIjpbMCwxMDMyNjQ4XSwiQ2FsY3VsYXRlZEFjcmVzIjpbMCw5NjM0MDUuMzUwNF19&location=43.428881%2C-120.156002%2C7.00

I filtered it approximately to the boundaries of Oregon,
then added "easting" and "northing" columns so that
we can get accurate distances between points.
(See add_utm.py for adding easting, northing to a CSV dataset with
latitude and longitude.)

This is an equirectangular projection.
There will be distortion in georeferencing
the map based on UTM coordinates (easting and northing), 
but it shouldn't be _too_ bad for the extent
of Oregon.
